The `<#if>` directive with `<#else>`, see the [directive reference](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_if.html) for more info.

## Description
You can use `if`, `elseif` and `else` directives to conditionally skip a section of the template. The condition-s must evaluate to a boolean value, or else an error will abort template processing. The `elseif`-s and `else`-s must occur inside `if` (that is, between the `if` start-tag and end-tag). The `if` can contain any number of `elseif`-s (including 0) and at the end optionally one `else`.

# Note
When you want to test if `x > 0` or `x >= 0`, writing `<#if x > 0>` and `<#if x >= 0>` is **WRONG**, as the first `>` will close the `#if` tag. To work that around, write `<#if x gt 0>` or `<#if gte 0>`. Also note that if the comparison occurs inside parentheses, you will have no such problem, like `<#if foo.bar(x > 0)>` works as expected.

## Examples
```
<#if x == 1>
  x is 1
<#else>
  x is not 1
</#if>
```
